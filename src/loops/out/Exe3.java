     * Write a program that receive a positive integer from the user and prints
     * if the number is a prime number or not
     *
     * Note: A "Prime number" is a number which is divisible ONLY by itself and 1
     * For example: 6 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 2 and 3
     *              7 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 7
     *              2 is a prime number
